      <h2>Expansion of Masjid al-Tazkiah </h2>
      <p>
        Masjid al-Tazkiah has been proudly serving this community for 24 years.
        With the growing community, we have long hoped to expand the Masjid to
        prevent overcrowding. In addition, the expansion would allow us to add
        more space for individuals to offer their prayers. Alhamdulillah, with
        the help of Allah, your donations have allowed us to start the expansion
        project. We kindly request the community to help us to continue and
        complete this project. By donating right now, you will receive the
        reward of a house in paradise. We appreciate the generous donation and
        we look forward to continue and completing this project soon. May
        Allah(SWT)reward you enormously.{" "}
