# Foundation of Lights 

This is the repository for the website for Masjid Tazkiah, located in Ocoee, Florida. This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Our History
Masjid Tazkiah, a beautiful masjid nestled in the heart of Ocoee, Florida, has been a spiritual haven for the past 19 years, Alhamdulillah.

The journey to establish this serene sanctuary was not without its challenges. It all began with a blessed idea that led to the incorporation of Foundation of Lights Inc. as a nonprofit organization in the State of Florida on November 17, 2003. About a year later, on September 22, 2004, the organization acquired the historic United Oak Methodist Church building, located at 120 Floral Street in Ocoee, Florida, and meticulously transformed it into a masjid that radiates peace and tranquility.

As word of the new establishment spread, many members of the community, near and far, were drawn to Masjid Al Tazkiah, and by the grace of Allah, the congregation grew steadily. To ensure the masjidâ€™s continued success and smooth operations, a constant flow of funds was necessary. On November 17, 2005, the Internal Revenue Service graciously granted the organization a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, making all donations tax deductible and encouraging increased support.

In a noble effort to create a verdant, inviting oasis for worshippers, the organization acquired the property and land at 102 Floral Street on November 10, 2008. With the influx of devoted community members, additional space was needed to accommodate the growing congregation. Acknowledging this, the organization purchased 137 S Cumberland Avenue on November 21, 2011. Today, the Masjid is not only a place of worship but also a beacon of hope and support for those in need. A Food Pantry operates on the premises, generously providing sustenance to low-income and needy families in the community regardless of their religions, race and ethnicity. 

The story of Masjid Al Tazkiah is a testament to the power of faith, unity, and perseverance in the face of challenges, all under the watchful eyes of Allah.
